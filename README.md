# DMTOS
A minimalist Arch Linux-based distribution.

# What is DMTOS?
DMTOS is a simple, lightweight, minimalist Arch Linux-based distribution that aims to be effective from all points of view. It uses very few resources (>500 MiB of RAM at boot) and is super customizable. It also aims to be user-friendly. :)

# Understanding this repository.
This repository contains branches for each release. Each branch contains the modified `releng` profile needed to build a working `iso`.

You also need `archiso` in order to build the actual `iso`.
